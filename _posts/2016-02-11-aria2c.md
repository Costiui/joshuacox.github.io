#### Download from all the sources at once

[aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) is one of those old tools that has been around forever but you forget about it.
It will download one file from many sources at once, saturating your download enabling you to take full advantage
of whatever connection you are paying for.  Of note, this sort of behavior is likely to give all other users in your 
house issues while you are consuming the entire connection bandwidth.  But if you're paying for the connection, 
why wait around on ISOz to DL?
Well I fired it up again to fight this awful century unlink connection, 
there are many useful examples on their [homepage](https://aria2.github.io/)
but let me give you a quick one that is missing from that list that names the output file 
(useful for those messy links from sourceforge), so as an example to download debian kde 8.3 for amd64

```
aria2c -x2 -o debian-8.3.0-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso  http://ftp.riken.jp/Linux/debian/debian-cd/8.3.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.3.0-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso http://mirror.steadfast.net/debian-cd/8.3.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.3.0-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso http://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/debian-cd/8.3.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.3.0-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso http://mirrors.bloomu.edu/debian-cd/8.3.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.3.0-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso http://mirrors.advancedhosters.com/debian-cd/8.3.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.3.0-amd64-kde-CD-1.iso 
```
